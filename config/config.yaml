# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)

# Inputs for development mode
# "illumina" refers to a CRAM file containing short-read, illumina reads
# "ont" refers to a BAM file containing long reads for a single chromosme sequenced
#       using Oxford Nanopore
# "known" refers to a bed file containing a list of known STRs
# "truth" refers to a gzipped VCF containing known, high-confidence variants for NA12878 (required!)
# Note: each file must have a corresponding index in the same directory
